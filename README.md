    At the moment I am a member of the Brain Computer Interface team at neuroTUM, a non-profit student organisation that has their roots at TUM.
    I contribute in various aspects and am currently trying to better understand how brains work for our ultimate goal - [the Cybathlon](https://cybathlon.ethz.ch/en/event/disciplines/bci)
